            Co-working is basically means having a common or shared workspace where different companies can work independently.
            Whenever someone speaks of a coworking space, the first thing that comes to mind is a group of enterpreneurs
            and startups huddles together, trying to give wings to their dreams. The reason behind this stereotype is the 
            face that coworking is relatively cheaper than dedicated office sapce and provides the entire basic infrastructure that 
            is needed for a company to function.
